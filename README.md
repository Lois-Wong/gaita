# GAITA: The Generative AI-powered Course Recommender

Navigating the changing landscape of Computer Science is more difficult than ever, for both newcomers to the field and seasoned professionals aiming to stay informed and up-to-date on trends. 

With a plethora of unstructured resources, self-learners are often left to haphazardly browse the web and enroll in the first or most affordable program they find--a method that not only impedes their success and overall satisfaction, but also neglects to consider their unique backgrounds, interests, and potential contributions to the field. 

We aim to solve this problem by developing GAITA, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that generates personalized learning pathways from open courseware tailored to individualsâ€™ specific backgrounds, needs, and ambitions.

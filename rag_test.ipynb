      "**Recommendation #1: 8/10**\n",
      "- This recommendation includes some specific courses aimed at foundational skills in NLP and AI. The course \"Build a Custom Chatbot in a Day with RAG\" directly addresses my query about RAG-based chatbots. However, the other courses provided are not specifically about RAG, though they do offer essential knowledge that could be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation #2: 9/10**\n",
      "- This recommendation offers a more tailored selection for my specific interest in RAG-based chatbots, particularly the \"Intro to Mistral AI\" course and the chatbot development course without programming. These courses are directly applicable to building RAG-based chatbots and seem very relevant to what I want to learn, providing a practical approach alongside foundational knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation #3: 7/10**\n",
      "- While this recommendation provides general courses that cover the fundamentals of NLP and chatbots, they lack a specific focus on RAG techniques. The courses mentioned would be helpful for building a general understanding but may not directly provide the specialized skills needed to build a RAG-based chatbot. \n",

    "    1. [Intro to Mistral AI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-mistral-ai): This course focuses on interacting with Mistral's AI models through JavaScript. It covers concepts that are applicable to various programming languages, making it beneficial for anyone looking to build intelligent applications, including chatbots that utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques.\n",
    "    2. [Building AI Powered Chatbots Without Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/building-ai-powered-chatbots): This course teaches you how to create chatbots without needing to write code, using IBM Watson's Natural Language Processing capabilities. Given that RAG chatbots can be built with limited coding knowledge, this course serves as a great introduction to the concepts and planning necessary for chatbot development.\n",
    "    3. [Learn to code with AI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-code-with-ai): While this course is aimed at beginners, it empowers you to create functional projects with the help of AI tools like ChatGPT. Understanding how to work with AI will be beneficial as you develop your chatbot, especially if you plan to involve RAG methodologies in your design.\n",
